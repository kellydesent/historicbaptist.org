                    Our church is blessed with people of various personalities, styles, and backgrounds. We have servants for your sakes, who preach not themselves, but Jesus Christ the Lord. We also have a Seminary featuring the Baptist International School of the Scriptures curricula. Our school offers Associate through Ph.D. degrees in this curricula known as School of the Scriptures. This curricula has been developed and proved for nearly 50 years. It is a biblically- based and -operated teaching system. It not only teaches the Bible, but does the teaching in a biblical order, using biblical precepts, and using only the Bible. We have had a number of faithful and proven men who are part of this school, who have graduated into eternity. We still have faithful men carrying on the work.

                    <br><br>We have Dr. Francisco Guerrero, serving as Vice President of the school and he is our Missionary to the Spanish Scriptures. Through Dr. Guerrero's effort of thirty-plus years of labor, the New Testament has been translated into Spanish based on the Textus Receptus. He oversees the international B.I. work.
                    
                    <br><br>All our ministers and staff operate under the biblical precept that we must Do BEFORE we Teach. Our Saviour taught us that if we were to say one thing and do another, that this is hypocrisy. Using the words of Jesus, woe to the snakes and vipers that would set themselves up as teachers, but they themselves offer no light. Blind leaders of the blind, is what Jesus called them. Our work has no place for hypocrites. A man must Do and Teach!
